<h2 style=""><b>USING A.I TO BUILD A BETTER HUMAN</b> </h2>
<p><br><font color ="black"> One idea that's been on my mind is using sensors on the opposite leg. The concept is simple: these sensors would gather information about how our natural leg moves, and then that data could be used to help program the prosthetic leg. It's like teaching the prosthetic leg to mimic the movements of our real leg. This could make moving around with a prosthetic leg feel much more natural and comfortable. </br>
<br>

Speaking of improvements, I've also been curious about attaching prosthetic limbs directly to the bone rather than using the traditional cup-like attachment. This might sound a bit complex, but the idea is that connecting the prosthetic limb directly to the bone could make it more stable and comfortable. It's like giving the prosthetic a stronger and more reliable anchor, potentially improving how well it works and how comfortable it feels for the person using it.</br><br>

Now, let's switch gears a bit. The thought of being completely connected to a car while driving is absolutely fascinating. Imagine driving a car where you can feel everything it's doing. You could feel the tires gripping the road and the pressure of the brakes. It's like you and the car are working together as one. This kind of technology could revolutionize how we drive and make it much safer. </br><br>

Lastly, the idea of an AI firefighting mask using colors to separate objects like the floor, people, and walls is quite exciting. It could help firefighters see clearly in smoky environments, which is crucial for their safety and effectiveness. This innovation could make a significant difference in their challenging and heroic line of work.

In conclusion, these thoughts can enhance our lives in various ways, from improving prosthetic limbs to creating more immersive driving experiences and even enhancing safety for our firefighters. It's all about finding innovative ways to use technology to make our lives better and more comfortable.
