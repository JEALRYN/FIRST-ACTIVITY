<h1 style=""><b>HOW FAR IS TOO FAR??</b> </h1>
<p><br><font color ="black">My reaction upon watching the video is a profound sense of amazement at the incredible advancements in technology that have significantly impacted people's lives. We are now acutely aware and conscious of the significant role technology plays in our day-to-day existence, aiding us in performing tasks, both simple and exceedingly complex. As I delved into the initial segment of the video, it shows that the experts featured in the video were really trying hard pushing the limits of what machines can do. They are actively working towards the goal of creating artificial intelligence that closely mirrors and replicate human cognition, encompassing our thought processes, emotional responses, and behavioral patterns but this can be only done with the collaborative effort between humans and intelligent computers.</br>
  <br>
On the second story of the video , it introduces a prosthetic arms that is far more better than the conventional one as conventional or existing prosthetic hands are  blunt instruments, and often quickly abandoned by their intended users due to its limitation .Experts adds analysis of machine learning to the nerve signals of the brain that will enable the user of the prosthetic arms to move and fold the finger depending on the reading of the probe with the users movement. And in all fairness two arm amputee, one is guitarist and another one is a drummer  tried the newly develop prosthetic arms and upon the trial both are successful.
<br>This profound advancement in prosthetic technology offers hope and promise to countless others facing similar challenges. It underscores the potential for technology to empower individuals and enable them to pursue their passions and dreams, regardless of physical limitations.</br>
<br>
Moreover, the video also thoughtfully addresses the prevalent misconceptions surrounding AI. And to be honest I am also a bit hesitant on how this machine can be far more intelligent than human and sooner or later will be able to pose threats as this machine is out of human grasp and control However, the experts in the video presented a reassuring perspective: rather than being replace by AI, we have the potential to be enhanced by it. This revelation underscores the idea that, with careful guidance and ethical considerations, AI can serve as a powerful tool to augment our abilities and contribute positively to our future.</br><br>
In conclusion though not explicitly stated and showed in the video , that what technology offers right now is also a thorough process of yesterday's collaboration of human and machine learning and pushing through what can we really do. We can't predict exactly what the future will look like, but we know it will be shaped by this ongoing partnership between human creativity and advanced technology.

As we stand at the edge of the unknown, it's crucial to approach this changing world with curiosity and responsibility. The video reminds us that technology has vast potential, but we also need to think carefully about it's pros and cons. By working together, following ethical guidelines, and making sure technology is used for the greater good, we can guide innovation towards a future that benefits everyone. In this journey of discovery and progress, there are endless possibilities, and it's up to all of us to make sure technology continues to bring positive changes to our lives.
