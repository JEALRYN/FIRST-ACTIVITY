<h1 style=""><b>USING AI TO BUILD A BETTER HUMAN</b> </h1>

The video made me feel both excited and a bit worried. I was excited because it showed all the amazing things AI can do, but I also had concerns about relying too much on technology and losing our human natural instincts.

I am amazed upon watching the first part of the video as this is really what I imagined when I think of the system of prosthetic arms to be improved ,the only difference is that in this video it tackles prosthetic legs.

On the video it also shows that, Mr. Ewing who had given two option to decide whether to keep his biological leg, even if it meant  pain, or amputate it. Personally, I would probably keep my real leg and deal with the pain, but Mr. Ewing chose to amputate his leg, He was really happy with his decision because it got rid of his pain, and he could go mountain climbing again . This showed me that AI can make a big difference in healthcare and help people make choices that improve their lives.<br>

On the second part of the video shows the use of A.I tools and machine learning to predict the future not only is but what it should be. I'm quite frustrated why they follow their guts in deciding to pit or to run the lap, what would really happen if they follow A.I strategy would they really win the race? This question will never be answer probably... It made me wonder if following AI predictions would always lead to success. It's a tricky question because while AI can give us useful information, our own gut feelings and human judgment are important too. Finding the right balance between AI help and human decision-making can be a challenge.</br><br>

On the other part of the video too. They also talked about a device (C-Thru) that helps firefighters see through smoke.The concept of the device is a helmet that had an enhance audio and vision on zero-visibility level, it outlines the surrounding geometry so that firefighters can navigate faster.  This is a great use of AI because it solves a real problem and can save lives. It showed me how AI can assist people like firefighters and make their jobs safer and more effective. In the first trial the device is working well but after a while the device suddenly shutdown that might probably due to wi-fi interference or cable disconection , after fixing it, they give it another try and give another go, This time the device works well and the operation is successful.

In the end, the video made me realize that AI has incredible potential, but we need to be careful not to rely on it too much. We should use AI to enhance our lives and make thoughtful decisions, keeping the balance between technology and our natural abilities.</br>
